# DeepDR
This program was made for the final exam in the course BDP.
 
DeepDR is a Matlab application where the focus was to create a user-friendly MATLAB GUI and deep learning-based segmentation algorithms to detect lesions associated with diabetic retinopathy. The tool detects four lesion types: microaneurysms, hemorrhages, soft exudates, and hard exudates. Designed for healthcare professionals in resource-limited areas. The automated process reduces human errors and improves diagnostic accuracy, makes faster, early detection and treatment to reduce the risk of severe vision loss for diabetic patients.

## Features
- Automatic detection of lesions
- Save the result (data and images)
- Previews of the detected lesions
- Test the IoU for the lesions
- Show quantitative results of the segmentation
